Nature<br /> A Cover of &quot;All I Want for Christmas is You&quot;<br /> Composer(s): Walter N. Afanasieff<br /> Originally sung by Mariah Carey<br /> <br /> I don&rsquo;t want a lot for Christmas<br /> There&#039;s just one thing I need <br /> I don&#039;t care about the presents <br /> Underneath the Christmas tree <br /> I just need to graduate <br /> But before I set the date <br /> Make my wish come true . . . Nature:<br /> All I want for Christmas is... <br /> You <br /> <br /> I won&rsquo;t ask for much this Christmas <br /> I won&rsquo;t even wish for snow<br /> I just want to see my data<br /> Printed in your centerfold<br /> <br /> I don&rsquo;t care too much for Science,<br /> Cell, PlosOne or all the rest<br /> My data deserve to publish<br /> In only the very best<br /> <br /> I don&rsquo;t need to demonstrate<br /> That my paper&rsquo;s really great<br /> Make my wish come true<br /> Nature, all I want for Christmas is you<br /> <br /> I won&rsquo;t ask for much this Christmas<br /> Just ignore reviewer three<br /> You can tell just by his comments<br /> That he&rsquo;s trying to scoop me<br /> <br /> I&rsquo;ve used all the latest methods<br /> Addressed all your concerns and more<br /> You can&rsquo;t ignore the implications<br /> It&rsquo;s all spelled out in figure four<br /> <br /> Oh don&rsquo;t you want to be the one<br /> To publish this science home run?<br /> Make my wish come true<br /> Nature, all I want for Christmas is you<br /> <br /> You, Nature<br /> <br /> Oh, my rationale is flawless for a start (look at that flow chart!)<br /> And my data are all significant -- three stars! (oh that&rsquo;s really hard!)<br /> So why are you delaying?<br /> You see I&rsquo;m going crazy<br /> Don&rsquo;t you want to be the only one to publish me? <br /> Won&rsquo;t you please take my paper tonight?<br /> <br /> Oh won&rsquo;t ask for much this Christmas<br /> In fact I&rsquo;ve got so much to give<br /> This paper can be all yours <br /> If you will simply accept it<br /> Oh this paper will cure disease<br /> And probably create world peace<br /> What more can I do? <br /> Nature all I want for Christmas is... <br /> You <br /> <br /> All I want for Christmas is you... Nature</p>
